The program I chose to make is a stock investment simulator! The main purpose of this program is
to teach the user the basics of stock investment (really basic) without any of the risk involved.
Furthermore, it's also meant to entertaining with a few options for game modes. So far, I've written
seven different classes each with a specific purpose. Inside of these classes, I have implemented
object creation, inheritance, a hash table, sorting, etc. I plan on finishing the rest of the project
which involves adding another class that deals with simulation logic and adding sorted vectors to track
rankings.
